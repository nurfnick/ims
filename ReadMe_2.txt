File Structure
- Each chapter's content is in one of the eight 01, 02, ..., 08 folders. Within each folder, there is a "figures" folder and a "TeX" folder. The TeX folder contains the text files that are used to typeset the chapters in the textbook.
- In many cases, R code is supplied with figures to regenerate the figure. It will often be necessary to install the "openintro" R package that is available on CRAN if you would like to regenerate a figure.
- The extraTeX folder contains files for the front and back matter of the textbook and also the style files. Note that use of any style files falls under the Creative Commons license cited in the ReadMe_1.txt file.
- The OnlineExtras folder houses a (single) online extra guide. The collection of such online extras will grow over time.

(Two of the authors of these guides are the same people involved with OpenIntro.) For a more authoritative review, the book "Guide to LaTeX" is an excellent resource.
